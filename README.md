# random_script for norns

This is a mod script for the Monome Norns, adding a random script combo to the script selection page.

Press `k1 + k3` to randomize the script selection.

For anybody curious, this approach can be used to add onto any existing Norns functions. The limit, as far as I can tell, is that the new code must run either before or after the existing code, making it harder to mod something in the middle of a function. If there's a better way, please let me know.
